        <p style="color: gray">I am a senior student at <a href="https://www.colby.edu/">Colby College</a> studying computer science and astrophysics.
            My research interests include machine learning, reinforcement learning, robotics and astrophysics.
            I recently started a new research on identification of independently moving object in curvilinear self-motion using deep learning under the guidance of Professor
            <a href="http://olayton.com/">Oliver W. Layton</a>. Meanwhile, I am also working with Professor <a href="https://cs.colby.edu/yingli/">Ying Li</a> on my honor thesis using multi-agent reinforcement learning for energy-efficient
        trajectory planning of drone network. We have presented the preliminary <a href="assets/poster.pdf">result</a> at Colby College Undergraduate Research Retreat in summer of 2021.
            My experience in machine learning started with Professor <a href="http://hannahewolfe.com/">Hannen E. Wolfe</a> with whom I did a year-long research
            using eye trackers and LSTM neural network for investigation of eye focusing and drawing, and generation of sketches. This project will be employed
        as a project tool in art department. I am currently applying for graduate school to further explore my research interests!</p>
        <p style="color: gray">I come from a small town called Funan in mainland China and I am a first-generation college student. Before entering Colby College, I was fortunate to attend <a href="https://www.lpcuwc.edu.hk/">Li Po Chun
            United World College</a> where I received full scholarship and gained the chance to interact with peers from over 80 different countries. This experience encourages
        me to think multi-culturally and inclusively which guides my exploration in both academic and extracurricular projects. I hope to incorporate such principles in my future research as well.</p>
        <p style="color: gray">I always look forward to conversations and research opportunities. Please contact me through the email on the left or you
        can directly find me in Davis Robotic Lab of Colby College. If I am not there, I am probably busy with: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Watering my 20+ plants.</li><br>
            <li>Watching a new horror film.</li><br>
            <li>Star gazing at the observatory.</li>

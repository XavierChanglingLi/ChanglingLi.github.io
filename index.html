        <p style="color: gray">I am a senior student at <a href="https://www.colby.edu/">Colby College</a> studying computer science and astrophysics.
            My research interest mainly focuses on embodied AI where I explore the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in robotics. I am currently working on my honor thesis with my advisor <a href="https://cs.colby.edu/yingli/">Ying Li</a>,
            comparing a cooperative model and a competitive model of MARL for drones' trajectories planning. My interest of embodied AI originates from my passion for art and science. Learning art from a young age gave me a different perspective to interpret and interact the world. Meanwhile, science
            provides me a logical tool to explore and understand my discoveries. When I found the field of embodied AI, I found a  perfect balance to express my creativity and logic.</p>
        <p style="color: gray">I come from a small town called Funan in mainland China and I am a first-generation college student. Before entering Colby College, I was fortunate to attend <a href="https://www.lpcuwc.edu.hk/">Li Po Chun
            United World College</a> where I received full scholarship and gained the chance to interact with peers from over 80 different countries. This experience encourages
        me to think multi-culturally and inclusively which guides my exploration in both academic and extracurricular projects. I hope to incorporate such principles in my future research as well.</p>
        <p style="color: gray">I always look forward to conversations and research opportunities. Please contact me through the email on the left or you
        can directly find me in Davis Robotic Lab of Colby College. If I am not there, I am probably busy with: </p>

            <li>Watering my 20+ plants.</li><br>
            <li>Watching a new horror film.</li><br>
            <li>Star gazing at the observatory.</li>
